Migrated to https://github.com/jeremyje/android-lockscreenwidget

An Android widget that prevents the lock screen from appearing when the screen turns on.

This application works for **phones** and **tablets**.

_NOTE: This widget does not work if you have an Exchange account that forces you to have a pin/password to access your phone._
